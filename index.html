        <h2>Why Join the Heritage Walk?</h2>
        <p>More than a walk — it’s a journey into the soul of Ahmedabad</p>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <section class="reason">
        <h3>1. Discover the Soul of Ahmedabad</h3>
        <p>
            Every step on this walk whispers stories of ancient wisdom, vibrant culture, and timeless art. It’s not just about old buildings—it’s about understanding where we came from and how our heritage continues to shape us.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section class="reason">
        <h3>2. Create Meaningful Memories</h3>
        <p>
            These aren’t just sights to be seen—they're moments to be felt. You’ll take back more than photographs: you’ll carry laughter in the narrow streets, quiet awe in ancient temples, and memories you'll proudly share with your children and loved ones.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section class="reason">
        <h3>3. Be a Storyteller, Not Just a Tourist</h3>
        <p>
            When you walk these heritage paths, you collect stories that are rich, real, and rare. Stories you’ll tell around dinner tables, in Instagram captions, and over cups of tea for years to come.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section class="reason">
        <h3>4. Connect with Something Greater</h3>
        <p>
            In a world moving too fast, this walk slows you down to feel the texture of carved stones, hear forgotten chants in temple courtyards, and remember what it means to be part of something larger than yourself—a living, breathing heritage.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section class="reason">
        <h3>5. Walk with Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            Your participation supports local communities, artisans, and guides who keep this legacy alive. It’s not just a walk—it’s a gentle act of preservation and love for Ahmedabad’s unique identity.
